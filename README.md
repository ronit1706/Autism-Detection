# Autism-Detection
* This project uses MFCC features, which are extracted from audio recordings, to train multiple models to predict autism.
* The python file stores the trained models as a pkl file, which can later be used in predictor.py (CLI) or ui.py (Streamlit based UI).
* The Models implemented are Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Network.
* The model that performs best is Random forest with a 90% accuracy, followed by Naive Bayes with 81% accuracy.
